General Guide for Olympic Trials prediction Scoring

For every olympic event please rank AT LEAST 6 swimmers from the psych sheet.  You may submit additional swimmers as alternates but these alternates only count IF ONE OF YOUR SWIMMERS SCRATCHES; does not count if they simply do not make the finals.
Please put all submissions here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKke7kpVU5nQbJni7n31QwsKsMeiihX1RtTIsTNIlt8/edit?usp=sharing 

In addition to rankings, please submit a guess for the winning time (At finals) for the event.  Bonus points will go to the winner.
A perfect scores yields 100 points, while being the closest to the winning time yields 15 points, so the maximum number of points available for each event is 115.

The exact scoring procedure has been carefully devised, reviewed, and tested so to properly reward the best predictor and the code is in this repo under scoring.py 

i will write a briefly TLDR though to simplify and provide clarity and avoid dispute.
